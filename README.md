### üõ†Ô∏è **How to run the app**
# Guide to Set Up and Run Your Flask App

## 1. Install Python
1. Download the latest version of Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).
2. During installation, **check the "Add Python to PATH" option**.
3. Complete the installation.

## 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
1. Open a terminal (cmd, PowerShell, or Linux terminal).
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project (where `SAFE` is located):
   ```bash
   cd path_to_your_project/SAFE
Create a virtual environment:
    python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
- Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
3. Install requirements.txt file (list of dependencies), use:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Make sure you are in the SAFE/APP directory and then type on CMD:
'python app.py' or 'flask run'
You should see an output similar to this:
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
